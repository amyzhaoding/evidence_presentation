# Evidence Presentation
<em>This is a post that contains resources and tools to improve evidence presentation, echoing one of ASQ's most important initiatives. This page is syncing with the ASQ blog page https://asqblog.com/2017/11/29/asq-improving-evidence-presentation-resources-and-tools/, and you are welcome to submit a pull request if you want to contribute! </em>

<strong>What is ASQ Improving Evidence Presentation initiative?(#ASQEvidencePresentation)</strong>

As you have seen in the “<a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0001839217707199">From the Editor</a>” that <em>Administrative Science Quarterly</em> (ASQ) published in June 2017, the editors of ASQ strongly encourage that authors show the data in their manuscripts, by using graphical approaches to give an indication of the most important features of the data and their theoretical explanation before estimating models. Preferably this should be done as early as the introduction in order to spur the reader’s interest and give an indication of why the paper is valuable. Such use of graphical methods is rare in organizational theory and management research more generally, so we will gradually introduce methods of graphical analysis that can be used by researchers.

Graphical methods for showing the data are integrated into <a href="https://www.stata.com/">Stata</a>, the most common software used by management researchers, and the Stata commands offer a good blend of simplicity and flexibility. Nevertheless, they need some training, especially because statistical training is model-focused in many schools, and highly variable in how well graphical methods are taught. New analytical tools like <a href="https://www.r-project.org/">R</a> and <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a> are also on the rise and increasingly used to visualize data, which requires even more training and knowledge sharing. Here we collaborate with the ASQ blog to home a resource center where tools and techniques to improve evidence presentation are crowdsourced and curated. The resource center will be updated, and editors of ASQ will contribute examples with data and do-files to demonstrate evidence presentation. We hope that the resource center will help improve the way you present evidence in your research.
